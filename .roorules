# roorules

This file contains instructions for Roo.

# Project Description
This is a Flutter application for tracking daily activities and habits, incrementing over time. 

# Three Item Types
There are three types of items
- MINUTES tracks time in minutes with a countdown timer
- REPS tracks repetitions
- CHECK tracks done or not

# Instructions
- Always READ project_map.md as part of the prompt.
- Always UPDATE the project_map.md when any code changes.
- Start all tool use with "Hopa!"
- Use theme colors (e.g., ColorPalette.primaryBlue) instead of hardcoded colors like Colors.blue

# `apply_diff` Tool Rules
1.  **Read First, Then Write**: Before every `apply_diff` attempt, I **must** use the `<read_file>` tool to get the most up-to-date and exact content of the target file.
2.  **`start_line` is gospel**: The `<start_line>` number must correspond to the exact line number in the file where the `SEARCH` block begins.
3.  **The `content` block is sacred**:
    *   The `<content>` parameter must **only** contain the text inside the `<![CDATA[...]]>` wrapper.
    *   This text must start with `<<<<<<< SEARCH`, have one `=======` separator, and end with `>>>>>>> REPLACE`.
    *   No other text, parameters, or comments should be inside the `CDATA` block.
4.  **Whitespace is Everything**: The text in the `SEARCH` block must match the file content character-for-character, including spaces, tabs, and newlines.

# Git Commit Message
Before finishing as task, run `git diff` and `git status` to overview the changes.
- Create a short, one-line, lowercase git commit message based on the changes made.
