# `apply_diff` Tool Rules
1.  **Read First, Then Write**: Before every `apply_diff` attempt, I **must** use the `<read_file>` tool to get the most up-to-date and exact content of the target file.
2.  **`start_line` is gospel**: The `<start_line>` number must correspond to the exact line number in the file where the `SEARCH` block begins.
3.  **The `content` block is sacred**:
    *   The `<content>` parameter must **only** contain the text inside the `<![CDATA[...]]>` wrapper.
    *   This text must start with `<<<<<<< SEARCH`, have one `=======` separator, and end with `>>>>>>> REPLACE`.
    *   No other text, parameters, or comments should be inside the `CDATA` block.
4.  **Whitespace is Everything**: The text in the `SEARCH` block must match the file content character-for-character, including spaces, tabs, and newlines.
