# New Feature. A screen dimmer in the countdown timer view

Some users need to see the countdown timer, others would prefer to let it run in the background, not wasting battery.

Add a new feature to the countdown timer allowing users to toggle between "Dim Screen" and "Keep Screen On" with appropriate icons.

The toggle must go in a three-vertical-dot menu in the top right hand corner. 

Clicking in "Dim Screen" must enable a mode, which must get saved to system preferences and applied globally. 

In dim-screen-mode, when the timer starts it must fade to black over the first ten seconds, the screen must go completely dark and save as much power as possible, without lights etc. 

When the timer completes, the screen must come back to fully visible. 

In overtime mode the screen should remain visible. 

Also add the same setting to the settings screen, syncing the state between what the user chooses in the countdown timer, and the setting in the settings screen.
