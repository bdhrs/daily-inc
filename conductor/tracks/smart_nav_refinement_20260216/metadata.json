  "description": "When an item's timer is finished, and I click the arrow pointing to the right which goes to the next item, Sometimes the next item is actually a hidden item or an archived item. In clicking the right arrow, I never want it to go to an item which isn't actually in the list. i.e. the item must be incomplete and active, otherwise it must not go to that item."
